# hello-world
Do I really need a description?
I'm Jaime from Slough, UK. I was originally born in the tiny Caribbean island of Anguilla and raised in Antigua. I'm 28 years old and live with my girlfriend, Charlotte and our 2 dogs, Ralph and Coco.

I recently decided that I wanted to learn how to code to help me progress some of my ideas. I enrolled on the Zero To Mastery course by Andrei Negouie and have loved every moment of it since. It has helped me discover a new passion that I never thought I had and has made my possibilities endless. So far I have learned HTML, CSS and now I am currently learning JavaScript.

My goal is to become a full-time software engineer and bring apps and ideas to life that have a meaningful impact on our lives.
